# Project Overview

Welcome to the AWS SageMaker deployment project! In this project I will construct a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. I will create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, I will deploy your model and construct a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.

# Project Instructions
The deployment project which I will be working on is intended to be done using Amazon's SageMaker platform. In particular, it is assumed that I have a working notebook instance in which I can clone the deployment repository.
